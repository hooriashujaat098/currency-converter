* How to update the DOM with dynamic values
* How to handle input and dropdown change events
* How frontend connects with real world data


## How It Works

1. User selects base currency and target currency
2. JavaScript sends a request to the exchange rate API
3. The API returns current conversion rates
4. The correct rate is selected from the response
5. The converted amount is calculated and displayed
6. The exchange rate is shown on the screen


## Why This Project Matters

This project helped me move beyond basic JavaScript and understand:

* Working with APIs

It improved my confidence in building interactive and real world web applications.
